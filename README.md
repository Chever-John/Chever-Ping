## Background Brief

In this project, I will mainly write some demos running in containers. I want this project to become a generic web framework that adapts to container development to quickly implement any ideas I want to try based on this project.

However, the foundation of everything is an agile project. Therefore, I will devote my thoughts on software development to this project and constantly think about how to achieve more elegant implementations.

## Roadmap

- Specification Design
  - **Project Documentation Specification**: Including user and development documentation and outputting the framework structure of the doc directory.
  - **API Interface Documentation Specification**
  - **Version Specification**: Follow the semantic versioning specification or SemVer, and release [the version thinking article](doc/devel/zh-CN/thinkings/version_standardization.md).
  - **Commit Specification**: Write [commit automation specification article](doc/devel/zh-CN/thinkings/version_standardization.md), research OpenAI's commit CI tool, choose Angular specification, and finally implement CI specification commit.
